      "content": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.\n\n### Why Java?\n\n* **Platform Independent:** Runs on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n* **Object-Oriented:** Supports OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, etc.\n* **Robust & Secure:** Strong memory management and security features.\n* **Large Ecosystem:** Vast libraries and frameworks.\n\n```java\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, Java!\");\n    }\n}\n```",
